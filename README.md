### ✅ Stage 1: Foundation – Core Tables and Data Modeling

#### 🔬 Skills Covered:
- SQL Syntax: `CREATE TABLE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`
- Understanding data types (e.g., `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DECIMAL`, `DATETIME`)
- Entity Relationship Design (ERD)

#### 💼 Objectives:
- Design and create the foundational schema for the e-commerce platform.
- Normalize the schema to remove redundancy and enforce data integrity.
- Insert sample data for querying.

#### 📄 Tables to Create:
1. `Customers`
2. `Categories`
3. `Products`
4. `ProductVariants`
5. `Orders`
6. `OrderItems`

#### ⚖️ Table Definitions:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    FullName NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Email NVARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    Phone NVARCHAR(20),
    CreatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

CREATE TABLE Categories (
    CategoryId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Description NVARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    CategoryId INT NOT NULL,
    Name NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Description NVARCHAR(255),
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (CategoryId) REFERENCES Categories(CategoryId)
);

CREATE TABLE ProductVariants (
    VariantId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    ProductId INT NOT NULL,
    SKU NVARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    Color NVARCHAR(50),
    Size NVARCHAR(20),
    StockQuantity INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductId) REFERENCES Products(ProductId)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    CustomerId INT NOT NULL,
    OrderDate DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    Status NVARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerId) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerId)
);

CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
    OrderItemId INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    OrderId INT NOT NULL,
    VariantId INT NOT NULL,
    Quantity INT NOT NULL,
    PriceAtPurchase DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (OrderId) REFERENCES Orders(OrderId),
    FOREIGN KEY (VariantId) REFERENCES ProductVariants(VariantId)
);
```

#### 🧵 What, Why, How
- **What**: `Products`, `Customers`, `Orders` are fundamental entities in any e-commerce.
- **Why**: Normalized design improves data integrity, reduces redundancy.
- **How**: Use `FOREIGN KEY` to link related entities and ensure relational consistency.

#### 🔍 Sample Queries:

```sql
-- Get all customers
SELECT * FROM Customers;

-- Get all products under a specific category
SELECT p.* FROM Products p
JOIN Categories c ON p.CategoryId = c.CategoryId
WHERE c.Name = 'Electronics';

-- Get customer orders
SELECT o.* FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE c.FullName = 'John Doe';

-- Get all variants for a product
SELECT v.* FROM ProductVariants v
JOIN Products p ON v.ProductId = p.ProductId
WHERE p.Name = 'Smartphone';

-- List all order items for a given customer
SELECT oi.*, p.Name AS ProductName, v.Color, v.Size
FROM OrderItems oi
JOIN Orders o ON oi.OrderId = o.OrderId
JOIN ProductVariants v ON oi.VariantId = v.VariantId
JOIN Products p ON v.ProductId = p.ProductId
WHERE o.CustomerId = 1;

-- Check stock availability for all products
SELECT p.Name, v.Color, v.Size, v.StockQuantity
FROM ProductVariants v
JOIN Products p ON v.ProductId = p.ProductId
WHERE v.StockQuantity > 0;

-- Orders placed within the last 30 days
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(DAY, -30, GETDATE());

-- Products with no stock left
SELECT p.Name, v.Color, v.Size
FROM ProductVariants v
JOIN Products p ON v.ProductId = p.ProductId
WHERE v.StockQuantity = 0;
```

### 📊 Stage 2: Reporting & Aggregation Basics

#### 🔬 Skills Covered:
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- Grouping and Filtering with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Filtering data with `WHERE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`
- Sorting results with `ORDER BY`
- Using `DISTINCT` to eliminate duplicates
- Subqueries (Scalar, Correlated, `EXISTS`, `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`)

#### 💼 Objectives:
- Generate insights and summaries from operational data
- Create reusable queries for dashboards and analytics
- Practice advanced filtering and data comparison logic

#### 🔍 Example Queries:

```sql
-- Total number of customers
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCustomers FROM Customers;

-- Total orders per customer
SELECT CustomerId, COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerId
ORDER BY TotalOrders DESC;

-- Average order value
SELECT AVG(PriceAtPurchase * Quantity) AS AvgOrderValue
FROM OrderItems;

-- Daily sales revenue
SELECT CAST(OrderDate AS DATE) AS SaleDate,
       SUM(oi.PriceAtPurchase * oi.Quantity) AS DailyRevenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN OrderItems oi ON o.OrderId = oi.OrderId
GROUP BY CAST(OrderDate AS DATE)
ORDER BY SaleDate DESC;

-- Revenue per category
SELECT c.Name AS Category, 
       SUM(oi.PriceAtPurchase * oi.Quantity) AS Revenue
FROM OrderItems oi
JOIN ProductVariants v ON oi.VariantId = v.VariantId
JOIN Products p ON v.ProductId = p.ProductId
JOIN Categories c ON p.CategoryId = c.CategoryId
GROUP BY c.Name
ORDER BY Revenue DESC;

-- Top 5 best-selling products
SELECT TOP 5 p.Name, SUM(oi.Quantity) AS TotalSold
FROM OrderItems oi
JOIN ProductVariants v ON oi.VariantId = v.VariantId
JOIN Products p ON v.ProductId = p.ProductId
GROUP BY p.Name
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC;

-- Low stock alert (< 10 units)
SELECT p.Name, v.SKU, v.StockQuantity
FROM ProductVariants v
JOIN Products p ON v.ProductId = p.ProductId
WHERE v.StockQuantity < 10
ORDER BY v.StockQuantity ASC;

-- Customers with no orders (using NOT IN)
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerId NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT CustomerId FROM Orders
);

-- Customers with no orders (using NOT EXISTS)
SELECT * FROM Customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM Orders o WHERE o.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
);

-- Products that have ever been ordered (using EXISTS)
SELECT * FROM Products p
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM OrderItems oi
    JOIN ProductVariants v ON oi.VariantId = v.VariantId
    WHERE v.ProductId = p.ProductId
);

-- Customers who have placed more than 1 order and ordered high value items (using subquery and HAVING)
SELECT CustomerId
FROM Orders o
WHERE o.OrderId IN (
    SELECT OrderId FROM OrderItems
    WHERE PriceAtPurchase > 1000
)
GROUP BY CustomerId
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Customers with orders in ANY status: Delivered, Shipped
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerId = ANY (
    SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders WHERE Status IN ('Delivered', 'Shipped')
);
```

#### 🧵 What, Why, How
- **What**: Advanced filters allow comparison and precise data slicing.
- **Why**: Business logic often requires checking conditions like existence, membership, or value comparison across subqueries.
- **How**: Use `EXISTS` for correlated checks, `IN` for set membership, and scalar subqueries for dynamic filtering.
